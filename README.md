#YBI Foundation Internship Projects
This repository contains machine learning projects developed as part of an internship with the YBI Foundation. Each project addresses unique real-world problems, from medical diagnostics to customer sentiment analysis, utilizing various classification techniques in Python.

Projects Overview
Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression
Predicting Women's Clothing Reviews Using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis
1. Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression
Objective: Predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on cell nucleus features.

Dataset: Breast Cancer Dataset (Provided by YBI Foundation)

Steps to Reproduce:
Import Libraries
Core libraries include pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Data Overview

Display the first few records and dataset structure.
Generate descriptive statistics.
Data Visualization

Diagnosis Distribution: Visualize class distribution.
Correlation Heatmap: Analyze feature relationships.
Data Preprocessing

Drop unnecessary columns and encode the target variable.
Split data into training and test sets.
Model Selection

Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Parameters: Maximum iterations set to 5000.
Model Evaluation

Confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report.
Visualize confusion matrix with seaborn.
Key Results:
Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Scores for performance insights.
2. Predicting Women's Clothing Reviews Using Multinomial Naive Bayes
Objective: Classify women's clothing reviews as recommended or not based on text content.

Dataset: Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews (Contains text reviews and recommendation labels)

Steps to Reproduce:
Import Libraries
Libraries include pandas, nltk, TextBlob, sklearn, and wordcloud.

Data Overview

Display the first few records and dataset structure.
Generate basic statistics and describe text review attributes.
Data Visualization

Word Clouds: Visualize common words in positive and negative reviews.
Data Preprocessing

Text normalization (lowercasing, stopword removal).
Transform text into numerical features with CountVectorizer.
Model Selection

Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes
Features: Word frequency features from CountVectorizer.
Model Evaluation

Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Key Results:
Prediction accuracy and insights on recommended and non-recommended reviews.
3. Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis
Objective: Classify handwritten digits using pixel intensity values.

Dataset: sklearn's Digits Dataset (64-pixel grayscale images)

Steps to Reproduce:
Load and Describe Data
Load images and target labels, then visualize a few samples.

Data Preprocessing

Flatten images for model compatibility.
Normalize pixel values to a [0, 1] range.
Model Selection

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Parameters: Default with a random seed.
Model Evaluation

Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Key Results:
Confusion matrix and classification metrics for digit classification accuracy.
